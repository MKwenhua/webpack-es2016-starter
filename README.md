# webpack-es2016-starter
Webpack ES2016 for Northwestern Coding Bootcamp
<strong>Setup instructions needed to set up:</strong>
<ol>
<li>download or fork the repo</li>
<li>cd into directory. For example if the folder is in your home directory: <pre>cd webpack-es2016-starter</pre></li>
<li>in the command line type: <pre>npm install</pre></li>
<li>To start the server type: <pre>npm run start</pre> <strong>or</strong> <pre>node server.js</pre></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>After changing files just type: <pre>npm run bundlerun</pre> in the terminal, this will run gulp(for CSS bundling) and webpack to transpile and bundle your JS code.</p>

### Video Tutorials/Overviews
<p> Since github does not allow Readme videos, I have included them on a route within the project
<ol><li>First run the server: <pre>npm run bundlerun</pre></li>
<li>Next go to: <pre>http://localhost:8000/videos</pre></li></ol>
</p>
<p><mark>note:</mark> In video #4 you may notice my several failed attempts at demostarting the difference between <b>NodeList</b> and an <b>Array</b> well the lattest release of Chrome earlier this year has added support for NodeList iteration you can read more about it here: <a href="https://medium.com/@devlucky/nodelist-object-is-finally-an-iterator-cc529d6e2490#.g8vwcqxhh" target="_blank">NodeList object is finally an Iterable</a></p>
